        <p>Whether you like mountains or not, they have a built-in superpower to charm everyone. They offer us more than just captivating experiences with their majestic appearances, regal ruins, unsolved mysteries, and winding roads. There is nothing that compares to the sort of stunning vistas and serene environment you get when you are at the top of a mountain. India is home to some of the most magnificent mountain ranges in the world that are picture-perfect and provide you with Instagram-worthy photos thanks to mother nature. There are several locations to sate your carvings for a vacation in the mountains, from the massive Himalayas in the north to the western ghats and the Nilgiris in the south. </p>

        <p>video games have steadily risen in popularity for years. And with the social benefits of video games becoming more apparent, the trend has only accelerated. Gaming is now a bigger industry than movies and sports combined.

    <p>Simply put, “Everything as Code” (EaC) is a way of managing IT infrastructure and building systems and tools that support modern software applications. It takes the manual processes and activities that people do and turns them into software code so that machines can do those things instead. Anything that teams need to figure out, agree on and control gets documented and “codified” as a configuration file that humans can read, and then machines can execute. </p>
